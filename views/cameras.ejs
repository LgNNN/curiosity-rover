            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 text-center">Navigation Cameras (NAVCAM)</h3>
            <p class="text-xl leading-tight  mt-2">Mounted on the lower portion of the front and rear
                 of the rover, these black-and-white cameras use visible light to capture 3D imagery.
                  This imagery safeguards against the rover getting lost or inadvertently crashing into 
                  unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover make its own 
                  safety choices and to "think on its own."
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 text-center">Hazard Avoidance Cameras (FHAZ & RHAZ)</h3>
            <p class="text-xl leading-tight  mt-2">
                Mounted on the mast (the rover "neck and head"), 
                these black-and-white cameras use visible light to gather panoramic, 
                three-dimensional (3D) imagery. The navigation camera unit is a stereo pair of 
                cameras, each with a 45-degree field of view that supports ground navigation 
                planning by scientists and engineers. They work in cooperation with the hazard 
                avoidance cameras by providing a complementary view of the terrain.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 text-center">Mast Camera (MAST)</h3>
            <p class="text-xl leading-tight  mt-2">The Mast Camera takes color images, three-dimensional stereo 
                images, and color video footage of the martian terrain and 
                has a powerful zoom lens.
                Like the cameras on the Mars Exploration Rovers that landed 
                on the red planet in 2004, the Mastcam design consists of two 
                duplicate camera systems mounted on a mast extending upward 
                from the Mars Science Laboratory rover deck. The cameras 
                function much like human eyes, producing three-dimensional 
                stereo images by combining two side-by-side images taken from 
                slightly different positions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 text-center">Chemistry & Camera (CHEMCAM)</h3>
            <p class="text-xl leading-tight  mt-2">
                The Chemistry and Camera tool is known as ChemCam. ChemCam's laser, 
                camera and spectrograph work together to identify the chemical and mineral
                composition of rocks and soils.
                Looking at rocks and soils from a distance, ChemCam fires a laser and analyzes
                the elemental composition of vaporized materials from areas smaller than 1 millimeter 
                on the surface of Martian rocks and soils. An on-board spectrograph provides unprecedented 
                detail about minerals and microstructures in rocks by measuring the composition of the resulting 
                plasma -- an extremely hot gas made of free-floating ions and electrons.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 text-center"> Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)</h3>
            <p class="text-xl leading-tight  mt-2">
                The Mars Hand Lens Imager is the equivalent of a geologist's 
                hand lens and provides close-up views of the minerals, textures 
                and structures in martian rocks and the surface layer of rocky 
                debris and dust. With this new device, earthbound geologists are
                able to see martian features smaller than the diameter of a human hair.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-5 text-center">Mars Descent Imager (MARDI)</h3>
            <p class="text-xl leading-tight mt-2">
                The Mars Descent Imager, nicknamed "MARDI," shot a color video 
                of the terrain below as the rover descended to its landing site. 
                The video helped mission planners select the best path for Curiosity 
                when the rover started exploring Gale Crater.
